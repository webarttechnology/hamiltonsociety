					<h3>What is a Rep Payee?</h3>
					<p>A Representative Payee is a person or organization appointed by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to receive and manage Social Security or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits on behalf of someone who is unable to manage their own finances. As a Rep Payee, we fulfill this important role, ensuring that beneficiaries' financial needs are met and their funds are used appropriately.</p>
